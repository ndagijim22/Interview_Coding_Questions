/*
   Check Balanced: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of 
    this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights
    of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

        ALGORITHM
    - Use the fact that two subtrees are balanced if their heights never differ by more than 1
    - recurse thru the entire tree, and for each node, compute height of its subtree
*/

int getHeight(TreeNode root){
    //base case
    if (root == NULL)
        return -1;
    return
