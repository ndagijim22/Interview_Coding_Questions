/*
        TOPOLOGICAL SORT IMPLEMENTATION
    - It is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v,
        vertex u comes before v in the ordering
    - it is not possible if the graph is not DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph)
    - There can be more than one topological sorting order.
    - The first vertex in top sort is always a vertex with an in-degree of 0
    - top sort vs DFS:
        - in DFS, we print a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adj vertices
            in top sort, we need to print vertex before its adj vertices

    Algorithm for top sort:
     - create a stack to store teh nodes
     - init visited array fo size N to keep the record of visited nodes
     - Run a loop from 0 till N
        - if the node is not marked True in visited array
            - call teh recursive function for top sort and perform the following steps
                - mark the current node as True in the visited array
                - Run a loop on all the nodes which has a directed edge to the current node
                    - if the node is not marked True in the visited array:
                        - recursively call top sort function on the node
                - Push the current node in the stack
    - print all the elements in the stack
